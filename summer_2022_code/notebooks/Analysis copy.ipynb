    "The NASA Exoplanet Archive has over 35,000 entries as of July 2022, consisting of duplicate values for the majority of planets listed. Thus, to eliminate the various duplicate entries, we initially read the dataset as a Pandas dataframe via the Pandas module in Python. After, we arranged all the entries based on the publication date of each planet in ascending order - which can be denoted as disc_pubdate. The sorting of data was crucial to preserving the most recent and accurate finding for each exoplanet, as we only intend on keeping the last occurrence of a particular exoplanet, since it is assumed to be the most up-to-date. The removal of duplicate entries in NASA’s Exoplanet Archive successfully narrows down 35,000 entries to simply 5,055 exoplanets. Thus, it yields an elimination of almost 30,000 planets standalone - making it a vital process when performing our analysis. \n"

The absolute magnitude of each star determined above was the visual absolute magnitude. To determine the bolometric magnitude and then the bolometric luminosity, a bolometric correction must be added to the visual absolute magnitude. The bolometric correction depends on a star’s spectral class (or temperature).

The average orbiting distance is dependent on the eccentricity of the orbit; if the eccentricity is small, the semi-major axis is a good approximation of the average orbiting distance, but if the eccentricity is large, the approximation breaks down. We decided that if the eccentricity of an exoplanet’s orbit was less than or equal to 0.2, the semi-major axis would be a good approximation of the exoplanet’s average orbiting distance. If the eccentricity was greater than 0.2, we used Equation 3 for the average orbiting distance, in which dₐᵥ is the mean distance averaged over time, a is the semi-major axis, and e is the eccentricity. If there was no value for the semi-major axis of a planet’s orbit, but there was a value for its orbital period, we used Kepler’s 3rd Law (Equation 5) to determine the semi-major axis, where T was the orbital period in years, a was the semi-major axis in AU, and M was the mass of the host star in solar masses. If the average orbiting distance of an exoplanet was within the CHZ bounds of its host star, we considered it to be habitable. If the eccentricity value for an exoplanet was null or the values for its semi-major axis, orbital period, and host star’s mass were null, we could not determine the habitability of the exoplanet. "
