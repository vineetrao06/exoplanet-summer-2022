    "# Exoplanet Summer 2022\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "The search for habitable exoplanets has been the purpose for our research this semester. Considering that there are thousands of exoplanets in the universe, we believe that there must be at least one that possesses the characteristics needed to support basic life - the capability to hold liquid water. The most important question, therefore, is: can a given exoplanet support liquid or molecular water? Whether or not this is possible depends on a multitude of characteristics unique to each exoplanet, including planetary radius, orbital period, stellar radius, and planetary mass, which work together to create an environment capable of life. The purpose of our research in Summer 2022 was to unravel this “mystery” by looking at data values from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (Planetary Systems Dataset). We started with a Python program to find and remove duplicate entries in the NASA Exoplanet Archives. We then analyzed multiple planetary and stellar data values through the analysis of luminosity and absolute magnitude to filter out a list for us to take a deep dive into. Subsequently, we conducted statistical calculations for further analysis. Further efforts were made by applying Albedo and Circumstellar Habitable Zone (CHZ) data to the analysis of the habitability of an exoplanet. In the end, we formulated a list of ten exoplanets that we believe to be capable of supporting life.\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "The purpose behind our search for exoplanets is to reveal the possibilities of life beyond earth. We have always looked at the cosmos as a dark and inhabitable vacuum, but the chances of Earth being the only planet with life in this universe are slim. All creatures look up to the sky, but the ability to question what is there is what makes the human species different from others. And the ability to persevere to answer this question has gotten us where we are. So far, we have been able to prove that Mars has very similar characteristics to Earth through robotic missions, and we are continuing to make new discoveries not only about Mars's geological history, but how we evolved as well. This knowledge will only be furthered by expanding beyond our solar system. Ever since the first ever exoplanet was discovered in 1992, there have been over 35,000 more exoplanets that have been confirmed to be present outside our solar system. We will deepen our understanding of our purpose as a planet, and be able to realize how significant we are. There are other benefits as well, such as the infinite resources space has to offer, and the reassurance that we can become an interplanetary species, but in this paper, we simply focus on addressing the first challenge: detecting exoplanets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Search for habitability\n",
    "During the hunt for potentially habitable exoplanets, we looked through the NASA Exoplanet Archive, searching for the qualities that would determine if a specific planet could be inhabited by humans. Since our goal was to identify exoplanets that can support life, we considered how to best succeed at this objective. We learned that the simplest method of beginning to check if a planet could support life is to find out whether or not the said planet can hold liquid water. This is because water, in its liquid form, has a number of characteristics that make it necessary for life. It can cause adhesion and cohesion, can dissolve more substances than any other liquid, and is able to withstand large changes in temperature. Although no dataset contains information about liquid water itself, we utilized various techniques to discover more about the exoplanets and their capability to sustain the “universal solvent.” One of these methods is deduping the dataset; this involves removing the duplicates of each planet with multiple entries in the set and thus making the data clearer. Another useful technique is Keplerian Mechanics, in which we define a certain planet to be habitable if other celestial bodies that are similar to the exoplanet in question (e.g. Earth and K2-18 b) are. The most important method we implemented this Fall is the five-number summary. Including statistics in our research greatly increased our productivity. Additionally, we tried to use other methods such as habitable zone calculations and albedo. Our result was a list of ten exoplanets whose characteristics matched those of Earth and K2-18 b."

    "The NASA Exoplanet Archive has over 35,000 entries as of July 2022, consisting of duplicate values for the majority of planets listed. Thus, to eliminate the various duplicate entries, we initially read the dataset as a Pandas dataframe via the Pandas module in Python. After, we arranged all the entries based on the publication date of each planet in ascending order - which can be denoted as disc_pubdate. The sorting of data was crucial to preserving the most recent and accurate finding for each exoplanet, as we only intend on keeping the last occurrence of a particular exoplanet, since it is assumed to be the most up-to-date. The removal of duplicate entries in NASA’s Exoplanet Archive successfully narrows down 35,000 entries to simply 5,055 exoplanets. Thus, it yields an elimination of almost 30,000 planets standalone - making it a vital process when performing our analysis. \n"

If the eccentricity was greater than 0.2, we used Equation 3 for the average orbiting distance, in which dₐᵥ is the mean distance averaged over time, a is the semi-major axis, and e is the eccentricity. If there was no value for the semi-major axis of a planet’s orbit, but there was a value for its orbital period, we used Kepler’s 3rd Law (Equation 5) to determine the semi-major axis, where T was the orbital period in years, a was the semi-major axis in AU, and M was the mass of the host star in solar masses.
